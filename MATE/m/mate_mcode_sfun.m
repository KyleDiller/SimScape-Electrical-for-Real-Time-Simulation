%MSFUNTMPL_BASIC A template for a Leve-2 M-file S-function
%   The M-file S-function is written as a MATLAB function with the
%   same name as the S-function. Replace 'msfuntmpl_basic' with the 
%   name of your S-function.
%
%   It should be noted that the M-file S-function is very similar
%   to Level-2 C-Mex S-functions. You should be able to get more
%   information for each of the block methods by referring to the
%   documentation for C-Mex S-functions.
